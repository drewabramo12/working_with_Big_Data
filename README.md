## Summary

The data analysis is showing that for this data there is not a positive bias toward vine reviews. The data actually shows that the community of reviewers do not have any interst in Vine as a service. The best analysis that could be done would to determine if there was a bias or not toward vine reviews would be to expand the analysis to a wider range of product reviews.
